## 🧠 Design Decisions

- Used **Flexbox** for navigation and layout alignment
- Used **CSS Grid** for displaying project cards and news items
- Implemented **responsive design** using media queries to support mobile, tablet, and desktop views
- Chose a **clean and minimal UI** for readability and professional appearance
- Added a **dark/light theme toggle** for better user experience

---

## ⚙️ Features Implementation

### 1. Responsive Design
- Media queries adjust layout for smaller screens
- Navigation and content stack properly on mobile devices
- Images and sections scale appropriately

---

### 2. Theme Toggle (Dark/Light Mode)
- JavaScript toggles a `dark-mode` class on the `<body>`
- CSS changes colors, backgrounds, and components based on the theme
- Hero background uses overlay adjustments instead of replacing the image

---

### 3. Profile & Hero Section
- Profile image styled as a circular image using `border-radius: 50%`
- Hero section uses a background image with overlay for readability
- Hover interaction displays a welcome message

---

### 4. Projects Section
- Displays project cards using CSS Grid
- Includes hover animations (lift, shadow, image zoom)
- Implements live search filtering using JavaScript

---

### 5. About Section Interaction

- CSS applies hover effects (scaling, color change, glow) to individual words

---

### 6. Contact Form
- Basic form validation using HTML attributes
- JavaScript prevents default submission
- Displays confirmation message upon submission

---

### 7. AI News (Data Handling Requirement)
